# Site Content

This repository is where content is planned and written for the [athenars.io](https://athenars.io) site. The articles in this repo are not the final articles you can find on the site. The articles here are planned, drafted and refined here, but they are further edited and developed in subsequent phases of the production pipeline.

The Athenars site aims to be a one-stop-shop for learning how to integrate smart home automation and local cloud-like technologies using open source, open protocols and open standards. It takes particular interest and focus on harnessing and finding insights from our own data.
