# The Network sub-system

Athenars has decided to utilise *Mikrotik* switches and *Unifi* wireless access points in our technology stack. To better understand how our decision fits into our overall system design, please see our other posts on our [system requirements](link) and [considered sub-systems](link) pages.

This will not be a blow-by-blow, feature comparison. We will however walk through and explain our reasoning for choosing Mikrotik and Unifi, and why both and not one, over the other options. A lot of this will make sense when considering our broader whole system requirements provided in the previous posts.

First, here are the main options that were considered:

- Mikrotik.
- Unifi.
- TP Link Omada.
- ==more here?==

And on.
